## Project: _bookmark_

_bookmark_ is a desktop book management application used for managing user added books to manage book records such as
last read page (bookmark), added goals and notes. A user will interact with bookmark through a GUI created with JavaFx and
invoke commands through a Command Line Interface style.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
