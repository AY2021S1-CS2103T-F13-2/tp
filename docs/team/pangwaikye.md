Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a book in the library.
  * What it does: allows users to edit the details of a book, in any order of details and any number of details.
  * Justification: This feature improves the quality of life for our users as they no longer need to add a new updated book, and delete the 
  previous outdated book. This reduces the amount of redundancies that the user has to do in order to modify at least one detail of a book. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete notes from a book.
  * What it does: allows the user to create a note and add it to a book. If you would like to remove the note, you can use the delete note command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now add their own thoughts and analysis of a book easily
  without having to rely on other applications. This provides a centralised storage system for their book related matters, increasing the user experience.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=pangpuncake&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
